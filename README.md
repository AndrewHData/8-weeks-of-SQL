# 8-weeks-of-SQL
 8 Weeks of SQL Challenge using SQL Server instead of MySQL/Postgres SQL.

 This is my attempt at doing the 8 weeks of SQL challenge by Danny Ma using Microsoft SQL Server syntaxes. I have also included queries required to create the tables (you just need to make sure you've connected to your localhost if you want to do them offline)
